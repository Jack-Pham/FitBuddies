# FitBuddies
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Inspiration

Living healthy and getting enough exercise is a real challenge when you lead a busy life – no wonder, ten-thousands of Americans want to lose weight or get in shape but fail to stick to their goal. FitBuddies is meant to help the common worker/ student/ stay at home parents take care of their health. With this app we hope to help contribute in encouraging people all over the world improve their health and increase their quality of life. (Also, one of our teammates failed to reach his goal of losing weight because he is a lazy couch potatoe.)

## What it does

FitBuddies provides customized exercise plans that help the users reach their goal. And because everything is easier with a friend, FitBuddies connects you to another user who is on the same path. This little bit of good-natured competition is that extra motivation you need to accomplish your health goals.

## How I built it

We built an Android app and used Python / Flask for the backend and MySQL for the database. We deployed the server on AWS.

## Challenges I ran into

We didn’t know each other before and worked together as a team through the whole process to make our idea a reality. Initially we decided to try something totally new and aim for a cross-platform app in Xamarin. This did not work out, so we spent a significant amount of our time trying to salvage all our hard work. Two of our team members are totally new to Hackathons, so we taught each other new things.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We are really proud of the idea and we know that it would attract a big userbase pretty soon after we polish the app.

## What I learned

Apart from the new technologies we learned, we all got a fascinating insight into each other’s cultures.

## What's next for FitBuddies

We hope to release a first version on the Play Store fairly soon. In the longterm however, we would like to take a broader approach to health and wellbeing – in the first step by helping users make better food choices.
